## Build your prompt based on the description the user provides 
## and the items that are available in the lost-and-found database.
## The model must follow the rules listed in the README file
## The function should return the system prompt and the user prompt.
## You may need to use json.dumps() to convert the available_items list into a JSON string.

## Logic to ask Qwen for all the possible matches based on the system prompt and user prompt.
## The function should return the response from Qwen.
def ask_qwen(system_prompt, user_prompt):
    pass


## Logic to parse the response from Qwen and return the result. 
## You may need to use json.loads() to convert the response string into a suitable Python data structure.
def parse_response(response_text):
    pass
    


## Logic to validate the result returned by Qwen.
## It should check if the result is a dictionary, contains the keys "matches" and "confidence", and that the values are of the correct type.
## If everything is correct, then it should check if the item IDs in the "matches" list are valid IDs .
def validate_result(result, available_items):
    pass


## Logic to display the matches found by Qwen in a user-friendly format.
## It should look something like this:
""" 
CAMPUS LOST-AND-FOUND ASSISTANT
==================================================

Describe the item you lost: I lost a black bag somewhere

Searching for possible matches...

## If no matches are found, it should display a message indicating that no matches were found, along with the empty list
